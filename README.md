# Running the Project

To run the project, you will need two computers: one for the server and one for the client.
Setting up the server:

If you are using Python 3.7.6 or a newer version, run the following command to start the server:

# Setting up the client:

You will also need to set up a client to see messages on the terminal. To do this, run the following command:
